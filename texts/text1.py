    With apologies to James Brown, the hardest working people in show business may well be ballet dancers. And at New York City Ballet, none work harder than the dancers in its lowest rank, the corps de ballet. During the first week of the company’s winter season, Claire Kretzschmar, 24, a rising corps member, danced in all seven performances, appearing in five ballets, sometimes changing costumes at intermission to dance two roles in a night.

But her work onstage did not even begin to capture the stamina required to be in the corps. Spending a week shadowing Ms. Kretzschmar was exhausting — she gave new meaning to the idea of being on your feet all day. Twelve-hour days at the David H. Koch Theater, the company’s Lincoln Center home, were hardly unusual: Company class each morning was followed by back-to-back-to-back rehearsals, with occasional breaks for costume fittings or physical therapy, and then by the hair-makeup-costume-dance routine of daily performances.

This weekend will be even more frenetic. Ms. Kretzschmar will appear in seven ballets from Friday evening to Sunday afternoon, when she faces a new test: taking on the title role of the Sleepwalker in George Balanchine’s eerie, proto-goth ballet “La Sonnambula.” Balanchine, one of ballet’s most important choreographers, was a founder of City Ballet, and remains its guiding spirit more than three decades after his death.

Being in City Ballet’s corps is not like being a member of a chorus line, or a backup singer. The company promotes almost all of its stars, the principal dancers, from within. So while the corps is expected to be able to move in startling unison, like a school of fish, and to assemble in straight lines and keep all rippling swan arms parallel, its 54 members are also competing for bigger roles and promotions.

“There is an element of competition, and people get different opportunities, but everybody just wants to do their best onstage, and everyone wants each other to just do their best onstage,” Ms. Kretzschmar said during a break between rehearsals last week. “We have all experienced so many extreme highs and lows that it’s almost that you have to bond with this group of people.”

Tuesday, Opening Day

10:09 A.M. COMPANY CLASS, ‘NOTHING FANCY’ Ms. Kretzschmar arrives early in the large studio on the Koch’s fifth floor, stakes out her regular spot at the barre in the back corner, and wraps her toes in paper towels before slipping on her point shoes. Dancers soon fill the room. Unity Phelan and Brittany Pollack bring their dogs.

Peter Martins, the company’s ballet master in chief, strides in, coffee cup in hand, and puts the whole company through its paces, as the rehearsal pianist plays Gershwin. Later he says: “George Balanchine used to tell me, ‘You know what class is about, dear?’ He said, ‘What we do is we brush teeth, we clean teeth every morning. Nothing fancy: We just keep the essentials pure.’”

11:30 A.M. REHEARSAL STUDIO After class, Ms. Kretzschmar — who studied ballet while growing up in North Carolina, came to New York to study at the School of American Ballet, the company’s official school, and joined the corps in 2011 — stays in the studio to observe a rehearsal of a dance she is learning, and then watches a new Pontus Lidberg ballet for which she is an understudy. At 1 p.m., she finally gets on her toes for a rehearsal of “Fearful Symmetries,” a demanding, propulsive ballet choreographed by Mr. Martins that she was given a principal role in. She pauses to ask how to time a climactic gesture in which she rests her head on her partner’s palm. “It’s a Hail Mary,” the ballet master, Kathleen Tracey, tells her. “Hope for the best!”

2:20 P.M. SLEEPWALKING ONSTAGE The wig needs combing. Few characters in ballet make as lasting an impression as the Sleepwalker, an enigmatic character with long, flowing hair who makes her unseeing entrance on point, holding a candle. But when Ms. Kretzschmar first steps out onstage in her new wig, the action briefly stops, as the ballet masters confer with Suzy Alvarez, the company’s hair and makeup supervisor, about how they want the wig to look.

It was the wig that first tipped Ms. Kretzschmar off that she was getting the part; even before the casting was announced she was summoned to a fitting. “I don’t think they would give me a wig if I wasn’t going to do it,” she said.

The dancers work on one-year contracts. Corps members earn roughly $1,100 to $2,100 a week, depending on seniority, and are typically paid for 37 to 39 weeks a year. Since ballet careers are short, many are in a hurry to make their marks.
